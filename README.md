**Introduction**

This assignment is to develop a Python script to automate the following tasks:

Read a list of keywords and their corresponding dates from an Excel file.
For each keyword and date, search for the keyword on Google.
Find the longest and shortest options from the search results.
Write the longest and shortest options to the Excel file on the corresponding row and column.
Requirements

**The Python script must meet the following requirements:
**
It must be able to read and write Excel files.
It must be able to use the Selenium WebDriver to automate web browsing.
It must be able to find the longest and shortest options from the search results on Google.
It must be able to write the longest and shortest options to the Excel file on the corresponding row and column.
Design

**The Python script will be designed as follows:
**
The script will first read the list of keywords and their corresponding dates from the Excel file.
For each keyword and date, the script will open a web browser and navigate to Google.
The script will then enter the keyword into the Google search bar and submit the search query.
The script will then parse the search results and find the longest and shortest options.
Finally, the script will write the longest and shortest options to the Excel file on the corresponding row and column.
Implementation

**The Python script will be implemented using the following libraries:
**
Selenium: This library is used to automate web browsing.
Openpyxl: This library is used to read and write Excel files.
Testing

**The Python script will be tested using the following steps:
**
The script will be tested with a variety of keywords and dates.
The script will be tested on different web browsers.
The script will be tested on different versions of Excel.
Submission

**The Python script will be submitted in the following format:
**
A Python script file (.py)
A README file that describes the script and how to use it
Sample Excel File

The following is a sample Excel file that can be used to test the Python script:

Keyword | Date
------- | --------
Dhaka | 2023-10-03
University | 2023-10-03
Cricket | 2023-10-03
Bombay | 2023-10-03
Football | 2023-10-03
Paper | 2023-10-03
